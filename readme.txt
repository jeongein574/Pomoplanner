== Description ==

The name of my project is ‘Pomo Planner.’ This project enables study 
planning by allowing users to add tasks and subjects to improve studying. There 
will be a feature that acts as a Pomodoro timer, which typically sets the study 
time as 25 minutes with a short break of 5 minutes and a long break of 10 
minutes, but could be altered by the user. Under the report page, there will 
be a display of study hours for that day and the leaderboard of subjects which 
were studied the most, and under the calendar page, there is a display of a 
calendar that stores tasks into each day of the month. The calendar page also 
shows the tasks the user should complete in order of importance by using 
optimization. If the task hour exceeds the set longest study time, the task 
will be divided into smaller sections for the user to complete effectively. The 
user may also choose not to use the optimizer and instead input the start and end 
time manually. 


== Instructions ==

- No library to be installed
- No fonts to be installed

- When the user downloads the .zip file, the user should open 
  "EinJeong15112TP.py" file in an editor. The Images and Sounds are stored
